#web_based_ordering_app.
This app is for uploading the image of the item that we want to order. The image classifier predicts the image type and if correctly identified, updates the order table for the item , quantity and order date . Currently , the image classifier only identifies sunflower/pizza/soccer ball/dalmatian/dollar bill.  
Future modification : The model will be retrained on images for grocery items so that this app can function as a grocery order updation app. This app then can sync with the grocer to place the order.
